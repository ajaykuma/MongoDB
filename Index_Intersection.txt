MongoDB can use the intersection of multiple indexes to fulfill queries.
In general, each index intersection involves two indexes; 
however, MongoDB can employ multiple/nested index intersections to resolve a query.

ex: collection-customers has 2 indexes
{ qty: 1 }
{ cust: 1 }

MongoDB can use the intersection of the two indexes to support 
db.customers.find( { cust: "abc", qty: { $gt: 15 } } )

To determine if MongoDB used index intersection, run explain(); 
the results of explain() will include either an AND_SORTED stage or an AND_HASH stage.

Think About compound indexes vs separate indexes and using benefit of intersection if using
index_1 and prefix of compound index
